2. **Launching Jupyter Notebook** and selecting the correct kernel. (If you have already installed, Open Recommender.mp4 to watch demo of Jupyter notebook)
3. **Loading the dataset** and generating movie embeddings.
4. **Executing the recommendation function** using a sample query.
5. **Interpreting the results**, including movie names, similarity scores, and clustering details.
